# proj3-anagrams

Modified by Ramsey McGrath

## Issues

Shouldn't be any bugs in this current version

## Changes

Removed unneeded minijax files, added an app.ini file for default values, JS in vocab was corrected to check and see if we have enough matches, flask_vocab was corrected to be a JSON handler, spaces were added between matched words, and the check to see if a user has done enough matches is fixed. 

## Docker

To use docker, run python, not python3
