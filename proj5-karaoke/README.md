# proj5-karaoke

Modified by Ramsey McGrath

## Issues

Shouldn't be any major bugs in this current version. Putting the js at the bottom of index is kind-of a hack'y way to implement.

## Changes

Used different location finder, moved JS into index, JS debugging, added endpoint for flask to serve our input data, README edited, added mapquest api js and reverse geocoding functionality

## Docker

To use docker, run python, not python3
