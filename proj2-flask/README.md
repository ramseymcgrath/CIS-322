# proj3-anagrams

Modified by Ramsey McGrath

## Issues

Shouldn't be any bugs in this current version
The makefile has python3 as does the start.sh script.
Ran okay locally and on my pi tester.

## Changes

Fixed css, fixed session management, made the printview black and white, protected pre.process by specifying the encoding of the input and an error handler.

## Docker

To use docker, run python, not python3
