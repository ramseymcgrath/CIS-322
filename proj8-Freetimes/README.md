# proj8-Freetimes

Modified by Ramsey McGrath

## Issues

There may be an issue rendering the free timeblocks depending on your browser. I also haven't included a client_secrets.json file by default, but you can specify one in the configs.

## Recent Changes

Cleaned up requirements, edited README, delinted a bit. Verified external modules and that my calendar matched.

## Docker

To use docker, run python, not python3
